You're asking about the tech stack to get real-time stock market prices. It's a bit more complex than just one tool! Here's a breakdown of the key components:

**1. Data Sources:**

* **Exchanges:**  Real-time stock prices come directly from stock exchanges. Major exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NASDAQ, and the London Stock Exchange (LSE) provide data feeds.
* **Financial Data Vendors:** Companies like Bloomberg, Refinitiv, FactSet, and others aggregate data from exchanges and other sources, then package and distribute it to clients.

**2. Data Delivery Mechanisms:**

* **API (Application Programming Interface):** This is the most common method for real-time data delivery. APIs allow you to connect your application to the data source and receive real-time updates. 
* **Market Data Feeds:**  These are specialized data streams that deliver updates directly to your application, often using protocols like FIX (Financial Information eXchange) or FIXT (FIX for Technology).
* **WebSockets:**  This technology enables real-time communication between a client and a server, allowing for continuous data streaming without constant requests.

**3. Data Handling and Processing:**

* **Data Storage:** You'll need to store incoming real-time data efficiently.  This could involve databases, message queues, or in-memory data structures.
* **Data Cleaning and Normalization:**  Real-time data may contain inconsistencies or errors, so you'll need to clean and normalize it before further processing.
* **Data Analysis:** You'll likely want to analyze the data, which could involve calculations, charting, or other processing.

**4. User Interface (UI):**

* **Web Applications:** Many real-time stock price displays are delivered as web applications, where the data is fetched and displayed in a web browser.
* **Desktop Applications:**  Some platforms offer desktop applications that provide a more interactive and feature-rich experience.
* **Mobile Applications:**  Mobile apps are becoming increasingly common for accessing real-time stock prices on the go.

**Example Tech Stack:**

* **Data Source:**  Bloomberg, Refinitiv, or an exchange API like NYSE's TAQ (Trades and Quotes) feed.
* **Data Delivery:**  API or WebSocket connection.
* **Data Storage:**  A database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
* **Data Processing:**  Python libraries like pandas or NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
* **User Interface:**  A web framework like React or Angular for building a responsive web application.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Data Latency:** Real-time data delivery can have slight delays.  Understanding the expected latency is important.
* **Data Volume:**  Real-time stock prices generate a lot of data.  You need to ensure your infrastructure can handle the volume.
* **Cost:**  Data feeds and APIs from exchanges and financial data providers can be expensive.
* **Security:**  Protecting real-time financial data is crucial. Implement robust security measures.

**For individual investors:**

* **Most online brokerage platforms:** These platforms typically offer real-time stock quotes as part of their service.
* **Third-party data providers:** Some companies like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and Finviz offer real-time quotes for free or at a low cost. 

**Remember:** 

Building a system to access real-time stock prices from scratch can be complex. For most individuals, relying on established platforms from brokerage firms or financial data providers is the most convenient and cost-effective option.
