* **Subsidiaries:**  Large companies often have multiple subsidiaries, each with its own chart of accounts.
* **Segment Reporting:**  Large companies are typically required to provide segment reporting in their financial statements, meaning they must break down their results by different business units or geographic regions. The chart of accounts should accommodate this.
* **Software:**  Large companies rely heavily on accounting software to manage their complex chart of accounts.

**Remember:**  This is a high-level example, and a large company's chart of accounts will be significantly more intricate. It is essential to work with a qualified accountant or financial advisor to design a chart of accounts that meets your company's specific needs.
